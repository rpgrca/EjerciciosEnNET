## Sorted Search

Implement function _CountNumbers_ that accepts a sorted array of unique integers and, **efficiently** wit respect to time used, counts the number of array elements that are less than the paramter _lessThan_.

For example, _SortedSearch.CountNumbers(new int[] { 1, 3, 5, 7 }, 4)_ should return 2 because there are two array elements less than 4.
