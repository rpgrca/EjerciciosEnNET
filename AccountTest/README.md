## Account Test

Using only NUnitLite 1's _Assert.AreEqual_ method, write tests for the _Account_ class that cover the following cases:

- The _Deposit_ and _Withdraw_ methods will not accept negative numbers.
- _Account_ cannot overstep its overdraft limit.
- The _Deposit_ and _Withdraw_ methods will deposit or withdraw the correct amount, respectively.
- The _Withdraw_ and _Deposit_ methods return the correct results.
