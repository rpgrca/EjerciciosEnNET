## Refactor exercise

This is a refactoring exercise from an important Bank in the United Kingdom. The legacy application has to be refactored to conform to the SOLID principles, trying to keep it as simple yet extensible as possible.

The starting code compiles and includes code for WCF and database that must not be modified, nor the entry point at Program.cs.

The code initial code lacks unit tests which should also be added during the refactoring.
