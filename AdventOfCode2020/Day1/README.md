## First Puzzle
Specifically, they need you to find the two entries that sum to 2020 and then multiply those two numbers together.

For example, suppose your expense report contained the following:
- 1721
- 979
- 366
- 299
- 675
- 1456

In this list, the two entries that sum to 2020 are 1721 and 299. Multiplying them together produces 1721 * 299 = 514579, so the correct answer is 514579.
Of course, your expense report is much larger. Find the two entries that sum to 2020; what do you get if you multiply them together?

## Second Puzzle
Using the above example again, the three entries that sum to 2020 are 979, 366, and 675. Multiplying them together produces the answer, 241861950.

In your expense report, what is the product of the three entries that sum to 2020?
