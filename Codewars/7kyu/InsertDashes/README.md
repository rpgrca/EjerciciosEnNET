## Insert dashes

Write a function *insert_dash(num)* / *insertDash(num)* / *InsertDash(int num)* that will insert dashes ('-') between each two odd digits in num. For example: if num is 454793 the output should be 4547-9-3. Don't count zero as an odd digit.

Note that the number will always be non-negative (>= 0).
