## Two to One

Take 2 strings s1 and s2 including only letters from a to z. Return a new sorted string (alphabetical ascending), the longest possible, containing distinct letters - each taken only once - coming from s1 or s2.

Examples:

```
a = "xyaabbbccccdefww"
b = "xxxxyyyyabklmopq"
longest(a, b) -> "abcdefklmopqwxy"

a = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
longest(a, a) -> "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
```
