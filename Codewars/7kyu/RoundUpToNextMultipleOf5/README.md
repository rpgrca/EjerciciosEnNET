## Round up to the next multiple of 5

Given an integer as input, can you round it to the next (meaning, "higher") multiple of 5?

Examples:

```
input:    output:
0    ->   0
2    ->   5
3    ->   5
12   ->   15
21   ->   25
30   ->   30
-2   ->   0
-5   ->   -5
etc.
```

Input may be any positive or negative integer (including 0).

You can assume that all inputs are valid integers.
