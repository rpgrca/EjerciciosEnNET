## Find Nearest Square Number

Your task is to find the nearest square number of a positive integer *n*. In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

For example, if *n = 111*, then the nearest square number equals 121, since 111 is closer to 121, the square of 11, than 100, the square of 10.

If *n* is already a perfect square (e.g. *n = 144*, *n = 81*, etc.), you need to just return *n*.
