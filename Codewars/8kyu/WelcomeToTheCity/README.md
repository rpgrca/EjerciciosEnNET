## Welcome to the City

Create a method *sayHello/say_hello/SayHello* that takes as input a name, city, and state to welcome a person. Note that *name* will be an array consisting of one or more values that should be joined together with one space between each, and the length of the name array in test cases will vary.

### Example:

```csharp
Kata.SayHello(new String[]{"John", "Smith"}, "Phoenix", "Arizona")
```

This example will return the string *Hello, John Smith! Welcome to Phoenix, Arizona!*
